# ip_subnet_calculator
A basic handy IP subnet calculator written in Python that can be used for IPv4/IPv6.

This programme is written in Python 3.7.

This is a IP subnet calculator that works for both IPv4 and IPv6. Most of us use online IP subnet calculator when required. I thought of giving the same flavor thorugh Python, thinking about the case where you have no internet access and need an urgent subnetting.

Here is the code to survive from this type of situation.
